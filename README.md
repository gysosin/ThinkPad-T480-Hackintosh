<summary><strong> ⚠️ Important Information for any i7 and/or macOS Sonoma Users ⚠️ </strong></summary>
</br>
	
### 🛜 AirPortItlwm for So is still not stable yet! 🛜
If you're using a ThinkPad T480, T480s or X280 that either is rocking an Intel Core i7 CPU and/or is running macOS Sonoma, please be aware that the ```AirPortItlwm``` kext is **NOT STABLE** yet. What I mean is that while the kext actually functions, **you will not be able to access any iServices (iMessage, FaceTime,etc.).** In order to have any access to iServices, please use the ```itlwm``` kext along with the ```HeliPort``` application until the ```AirPortItlwm``` kext is updated.
</details>


<details>  
<summary><strong>📝 Requirements</strong></summary>
</br>

You must have the following items:
- Lenovo ThinkPad T480 (Obviously 😁).
- Access to a working Windows machine with Python installed.
- A pendrive with more than 4 GB (Remember that during the preparation we will format the flash drive to create the installation media). (For Sequoia and newer, you'll need a drive with 32 GB of storage because Sequoia and newer only work with the offline installer for now.)
- an Internet connection (recommended via Ethernet).
- 1-2 hours of your time.

</details>

<details>  
<summary><strong>⚙️ macOS Sequoia Installer Guide</strong></summary>
</br>

**Since Wi-Fi does not work until you apply a post-install patch, the only way to install Sequoia is through the offline installer method.**

Step 1: Download macOS Installer on Windows. Use gibMacOS to download the macOS installer.

- [![Download](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-gibmacOS-red.svg)](https://github.com/corpnewt/gibMacOS)
- Extract and run gibMacOS.bat in Windows.
- When the terminal opens, you’ll see a list of macOS versions. Select macOS 15 Sequoia by entering its index number.
- Wait for the download to complete; it will save the files in a new directory.

Step 2: Convert the Downloaded Files into an Installer

You need to use a macOS or macOS virtual machine to convert these .pkg files into a macOS installer. Here’s how:

- Copy the downloaded folder from your Windows machine to a macOS machine or a virtual macOS environment.
- On the macOS machine:
	Open Terminal and navigate to the folder containing the downloaded files. Run the following command:bashCopy codesudo installer -pkg InstallAssistant.pkg -target /Applications
	This command will install the macOS installer to your Applications folder.
	After running this command, you should now see Install macOS Sequoia in the Applications folder on macOS.

- With the installer on macOS, follow these steps to make the USB bootable:

	Insert the USB drive into the macOS system.
	Open Disk Utility, select the USB drive, and format it as Mac OS Extended (Journaled) with the GUID Partition Map scheme. Name it something like MyUSB.
	Open Terminal and run the following command, which will create a bootable USB with the macOS installer:Replace MyUSB with the name of your USB drive if different.bashCopy code sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Sequoia.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyUSB
	This will erase the USB and copy the installer files onto it, making it bootable.

Step 3: Copy OpenCore Files to the USB Drive

- Mount the USB drive, and within the EFI partition, copy over the EFI folder that you configured with OpenCore.
Now your USB should be fully prepared to boot into macOS Sequoia via OpenCore.

<summary><strong>⚙️ Preperation</strong></summary>
</br>

### Create the install media

First of all, you will need the install media of macOS. I will use [macrecovery](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg) to download and create the macOS Install media.

With macrecovery, the process is the following:
- Download [OpenCorePkg](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg) as a ZIP.
- Extract the OpenCorePkg-master.zip file.
- Open ```cmd.exe``` with Administrator privileges and change the directory to OpenCorePkg-master\Utilities\macrecovery.
- Enter the following command to download macOS:
```
# Monterey (12)
python macrecovery.py -b Mac-E43C1C25D4880AD6 -m 00000000000000000 download

# Ventura (13)
python macrecovery.py -b Mac-7BA5B2D9E42DDD94 download

# Sonoma (14)
python macrecovery.py -b Mac-CFF7D910A743CAAF -m 00000000000000000 download
```
- After the download succeeded, type ```diskpart``` and wait until you see ```DISKPART>```

- Plug-in your pendrive and type ```list disk``` to see your disk id.

- Select your pendrive by typing ```select disk <diskid>```

- Now we are gonna clean the pendrive and convert it to GPT. First, type ```clean``` and then ```convert gpt```.

>  **Note**: If an error occurred, try to convert again by typing ```convert gpt```.

- After the pendrive is clean and converted, we will create a new partition where we can put our files on. First, type ```create partition primary```, then select the new partition with ```select partition 1``` and format it ```format fs=fat32 quick```.

- Finally, mount your pendrive by typing ```assign```

- Now, close the Command Prompt and create the folder ```com.apple.recovery.boot``` on the pendrive. Copy ```OpenCorePkg-master\Utilities\macrecovery\BaseSystem.dmg``` and ```Basesystem.chunklist``` into that folder.

>  **Note**: If you can't find BaseSystem.dmg, use RecoveryImage.dmg and RecoveryImage.chunklist instead.

After the install media was created, we need to make the USB drive bootable.

### Configure and install OpenCore
Download the EFI folder from this repo, you will find the latest files under the release tab or just download the repo as it is. Move the folder to the root of your pendrive (e.g. J:\) and rename the folder to ```EFI```.

#### GenSMBIOS
We need a script, called [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS), to create fake serial number, UUID and MLB numbers. **This step is essential to have working iMessage, so do not skip it!**

The process is the following:

- Download GenSMBIOS as a ZIP, then extract it.
- Start GenSMBIOS.bat and use option ```1``` to download MacSerial.
- Choose option ```2```, to select the path of the config.plist file. It will be located in ```EFI -> OC``` folder.
- Choose option ```3```, and enter ```MacBookPro15,2``` as the machine type.
- Press ```Q``` to quit. Your config now should contain the requied serials.

#### Enter the proper ROM value
After adding serials to your config.plist, you have to add the computer's MAC address to the config.plist file. **This step is also essential to have a working iMessage, so do not skip it.** We need a Plist editior, to write the MAC address into the config.plist file. I used [ProperTree](https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree), since it works on Windows too. You have to change the MAC address value in the config.plist at

```PlatformInfo -> Generic -> ROM```

Delete the generic ```112233445566``` value, and enter your MAC address into the field, without any colons. Save the Plist file, and it is now ready to be written out to the EFI partition of your install media.

#### Default keyboard layout and language
The default keyboard layout and language is ```German```. To change the language, edit the value of ```NVRAM -> Add -> 7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82 -> prev-lang:kbd``` to the value of your language. If your value contains an underscore "```_```", replace it with a hyphen "```-```". The value for English would be ```en-US:0```. You can find a list of all language values [here](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/blob/master/Utilities/AppleKeyboardLayouts/AppleKeyboardLayouts.txt).

##### ACPI patches
Please enable / disable the following patches depending on what is installed in your device.

| SSDT              | Affected device            | Description                                                |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| SSDT-ARPT.aml     | Broadcom cards             | Disable Broadcom card during sleep                         |
| SSDT-OFFTB.aml    | Thunderbolt                | Disable Thunderbolt                                        |
| SSDT-OFFGDGPU.aml | NVIDIA GeForce MX 150      | Disable NVIDIA GPU (necessary if installed)                |

### Install OpenCore
After you've finished with the neccesary tweaks, you have to copy the EFI folder to the EFI partition of your pendrive.

Now you can go through the install.

### Install macOS
1. Boot from USB, press ```SPACE``` and select the USB drive inside of OpenCore ```"NO NAME (DMG)" or similar```.
>  **Note:** The first boot may take up to 20 minutes.
2. Wait for the macOS Utilities screen.
3. Select Disk Utility, select your disk and click erase. Give a name and choose **APFS** with **GUID Partition Map**.
4. After erasing, go back and select **Reinstall macOS** and follow the steps on your screen. The installation make take up to **2 hours**.
>  **Note:** Your PC will restart multiple times. Just boot from USB and select your disk inside of OpenCore. (named macOS Installer or the disk name).
5. Once you see the `Region selection` screen, you are good to proceed.
6. Create your user accound and everything else.

<details>  
<summary><strong>♻️ Upgrade macOS / Switch EFI</strong></summary>
</br>

If you plan to upgrade your macOS (or updating the EFI / switching to HeliPort), you'll need a different OpenCore configuation (EFI). Please follow these steps:

> Note: Download the desired macOS version in the Settings before following these steps, if you are connected via WiFi.

1. Download the newest release & [ProperTree](https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree) and extract it.
2. Start ProperTree and load the ```Config.plist``` on your EFI partition. (File -> Open)
> Note: You can mount your EFI partition by pressing ```ALT + SPACE```, typing Terminal and enter the following command: ```sudo diskutil mountDisk disk0s1```.
3. Now also load the new configuration file from the repo for the desired macOS installation (or HeliPort config). 
4. You should now have 2 ProperTree-windows open on your screen.
5. Go in both windows to ```Root -> PlatformInfo -> Generic```. Transfer ```MLB, ROM, SystemProductName, SystemSerialNumber and SystemUUID``` to the new config. 
6. Save the new config (File -> Save) and close both windows.
7. Now delete your existing EFI folder from the EFI partition and copy the new one to it. (Make sure that the Directorys ```Boot and OC``` are in ```EFI```).

If you want to upgrade macOS, download the desired macOS version in the Settings app and perform the upgrade like on a real Mac.

## Post-Install Guide

<details>  
<summary><strong>💾 Install OpenCore to your boot drive</strong></summary>
</br>

1. Press `ALT + SPACE` and open terminal. Type `sudo diskutil mountDisk disk0s1` (where disk0s1 corresponds to the EFI partition of the main disk)
2. Open Finder and copy the EFI folder of your USB device to the main disk's EFI partition.
3. Unplug the USB device and reboot your laptop. Now you can boot macOS without your USB device.

</details>

<details>  
<summary><strong>✏️ Create an offline installer (Optional)</strong></summary>
</br>

In case of reinstalling macOS, a offline install media can save some time. You also don't need an Ethernet connection for the installation.
To create a offline install media, you need the following stuff: 

- macOS Installer from the App Store.
- A 16 GB pendrive (Keep in mind, during the preperation we will format the disk to create the install media).

Press `ALT + SPACE` and open Disk utility. Select your USB device and click erase. Name it `MyUSB` and choose **Mac OS Extended** with **GUID Partition Map**. After erasing the USB device, close Disk utility.

Now press `ALT + SPACE` and open terminal. Type the following command:

Big Sur:
```sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Big\ Sur.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyUSB --downloadassets```

Monterey:
```sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Monterey.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyUSB --downloadassets```

After creating the install media, copy your EFI folder to the EFI partition of your USB device.

<summary><strong>🛜 Intel Wi-Fi Patch for macOS Sequoia </strong></summary>
</br>

**Intel Wi-Fi does not work on macOS Sequoia unless you install this patch.**

> Credit to [ResQre](https://github.com/ResQre) for these instructions

What you need
- Intel Wi-Fi Card (of course)
- Hackintool (for device path) + your favorite plist editor (in my case, OCAuxiliaryTools)
- [OpenCore Legacy Patcher](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher) 

1. Open Hackintool and go to the Pcie menu, look for where it says "Intel Wireless" (in my case, Wireless 8260).
![ภาพถ่ายหน้าจอ 2024-12-26 เวลา 1 49 07 AM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93566ae7-5b73-47ba-8d26-b1241e8c8dda)

2. Open a .plist editor (in this case, we'll use OCAuxiliaryTools), add the device path (without #), then add the following device details:

| Key   |      Data Type      |  Value |
|----------|:-------------:|:------:|
| IOName |  String | pci14e4,43a0|
| compatible |    String   | pci106b,117 |
| device-id | Data | A0430000 |
| device_type | String | Network Controller |
| model | String | BCM4360 802.11ac Wireless Network Adapter |
| name | String | pci14e4,43a0 |
| pci-aspm-default | Number | 0 |
| subsystem-id | Data | 17010000 |
| subsystem-vendor-id | Data | 6B100000 |
| vendor-xt | Data | E4140000 |

It should look like this:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a7b1d5b-29a7-4740-aaba-9ce1eb661f3f)


Press save and reboot (no need for setting the kext up since it's already presented inside of the efi.)

3. If you done the setup correctly, you should be able to install the OCLP root patch.

![ภาพถ่ายหน้าจอ 2024-12-26 เวลา 2 36 01 AM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a44dd01-c7cf-4db5-8db7-e54683529687)

4. Install the patch, then you can remove the spoof id (or add the # instead) and Intel Wi-Fi should work without the need for Heliport.
